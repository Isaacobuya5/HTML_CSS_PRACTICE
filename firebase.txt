Firebase & Firestore Review
QueryReferences, Snapshots and Security Rules

-> Query; is a request that we make to a firestore to give us something from the database.
Firestore then return us either References object or Snapshot object.
- Of these objects, they can either be Document or Collection versions.
-> Firestore will always return us these objects even if nothing exists from that query.

queryReference Object -> is an object that represents the "current" place in the database that we are querying.
We get them by calling either;
firestore.doc("/users/:userId");
firestore.collections('/users');

-> It does not have the actual data of the collection or document. Instead has properties that tell us details about it, or the method to get the Snapshot object
which gives us the data we are looking for.

DocumentReference versus CollectionReference object
-> We use documentRef objects to perform our CRUD methods, i.e. (create, retrieve, update, delete).
The documentRef methods are .set(), .get(), .update() and .delete() respectively.

We can also add documents to collections using the collectionRef object using the .add() method.
collectionRef.add({//value: prop})
// We get the the snapshotObject from the referenceObject using the .get() method i.e. documentRef.get() or collectionRef.get()

documentRef returns a documentSnapshot object
collectionRef returns a querySnapshot object i.e. collectionSnapshot object.

DocumentSnapshot
- We get a documentSnaphot object from our documentReference object.
- It allows us to check if a document exists at this query using the .exists property which returns a boolen.
- We can also get the actual properties on the object by calling the .data() (snapshot.data()) method, which returns a JSON object
of the document.

QuerySnapshot
-> We get QuerySnapshot from our collectionReference object.
-> We can check if there are any documents in the collection by calling the .empty property which returns a boolean.
-> We can get all documents in the collection by calling .docs property.
. It returns an array of our documents as documentSnapshot objects.

Most important from querySnapshot are;
* docs
* empty()
* size
