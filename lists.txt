Working with Lists

Using an Image as a List Item Marker
-> There may come a time when the default "list-style-type" property values are not
enough and we want to customize our own list item marker.
-> Doing so is most commonly accomplished by placing a background image on each <li> elements within a list.

-> The process includes removing any default list-style-type property value and adding a background image and padding to the li element.
-> "list-style-type" property value of "none" will remove any existing list item markers.
-> The "background" property will identify a background image along with its position and repeate value if necessary.
-> Adding "padding" property to the left will provide space to the left of the text for the background image.

Example
<ul>
  <li>Orange</li>
  <li>Green</li>
  <li>Blue</li>
</ul>

CSS
li {
  background: url("arrow.png") 0 50% no-repeat;
  list-style-type: none;
  padding-left: 12px;
}


List Style Position.
-> By default, list item marker is to the left of the content within the <li> element.
-> This list style positioning is described as "outside", meaning all content will appear directly to the right, outside of the list item marker.
-> However, using "list-style-position" property, we can change the default value of "outside" to "inside" or "inherit".

-> The "outside" property value places the list item marker to the left of the <li> element and doesn't allow
any content to wrap below the list item marker.
-> The inside property value ( which is rarely seen or used) places the list item marker in line with the first line of the <li> element and allows other content to wrap below it as needed.

Shorthand List Style Property
-> "list-style" is shorthand use to combine "list-style-type" and "list-style-position".

Example;
ul {
  list-style: circle inside;
}
ol {
  list-style: lower-roman;
}

Horizontally Displaying List
-> Occassionally, we may want to display list horizontally rather than vertically.
-> Perharps, we want to divide a list into multiple columns, to build a navigational list or to put a few list items in a single row.
-> Ways of displaying list as a single line include;
  * making "display" property value of <li> elements inline or inline-block;
  * floating them.
-> Setting the "display property" for the list items to "inline-block" is often the most desirable as it allows us
to easily add vertical margins and other spacing to the <li> elements whereas inline does not.
-> When changing the display property value to "inline" or "inline-block", the list item marker be it a bullet, number or other styles is removed.

Example
<div class="container">
<ul>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Services</li>
  <li>Blog</li>
</ul>
<!--   <div class="clear"></div> -->
</div>

Example CSS
* {
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 0px;
}
body {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}
.container {
  width: 80%;
  height: 40vh;
  background-color: teal;
  position: relative;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
ul {
position: absolute;
right: 0;
top: 20px;
}
li {
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0 10px;
}
