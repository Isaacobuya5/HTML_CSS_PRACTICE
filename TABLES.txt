Organizing Data with Tables

-> HTML tables were created to provide a straightforward way to mark up structured tabular data and to display
that data in a form that is easy for users to read and digest.
-> When HTML was being developed, CSS was not widely supported in browsers, so tables were the primary means by which
websites were built.

-> They were used for positioning content as well as for building the overal layout of a page.
-> Fortunately today, tables are used specifically for "organizing data" like they should and CSS
is free to get on with the jobs of positioning layout and content.

Creating a Table 
-> Tables are usually made up of data that is contained within columns and rows and HTML supplies different elements for defining and structuring these items.
-> At a minimum, a table must consist of 
  * <table>, 
   * <tr> (table row).
   * <td> (table data).
   
-> For greater structure and additional semantic value, tables may include the;
  * <th> - table header
  * etc

Table Header
-> To designate a heading for a column or row of cells, the table header element, <th> should be used.
-> The <th> element works just like <td> element in that it creates a cell for data.
-> * The value to using <th> element over the <td> element is that the "table header" element provides a semantic value by signifying 
that the data within the cell is a heading while the <td> element only represents a generic piece of data.
-> Table headers may be used with both "columns" and "rows"; the data within a table determines where the headers are appropriate.
-> The "scope" attribute indicates with the values of "col","row","colgroup" and "rowgroup" whether a table header applies to a "row" or a "column";
-> The most commonly used values are "col" and "row".

-> The "col" value indicates that every cell within the column relates directly to that table header.
-> The "row" value indicates that every cell within the row relates directly to that table header.
-> Using the <th> element along with the "scope" attribute, tremendeously helps screen readers and assistive technologies make sense of a table.

-> Additionally depending on the browser, table headers may receive some default styling usually bold and centered.

-> The headers attribute
-> The headers attribute is very similar to the scope attribute.
-> By default, the scope attribute may only be used on the <th> element.
-> In the case that a cell, either a <td> or <th> element needs to be associated with a different header,
the "headers" attribute comes into play.
-> The value of the "headers" attribute on a <td> or <th> element needs to match the "id" attribute of the
<th> element that cell pertains to.

Table Structure
* <caption>
* <thead>
* <tbody>
* <tfoot>
-> helps organize the data and structure of a table 

Table Caption
-> The <caption> element provides a caption/ title of a table.
-> Caption help users identify what the table pertains to and what data they can expect to find within it.
-> The <caption> element must come immediately after the opening the <table> tag and it is positioned to the top of the table by default.

Example
<table>
  <caption>Design and Front-End Development Books</caption>
  ...
</table>

Table Head, Body and Foot.
=> The content within tables can be broken up into multiple groups, including
a "head","bod" and "foot".
-> The <thead> (table head), <tbody> (table body) and <tfoot> (table foot) elements help to structurally organize tables.

* -> The table head element, <thead> wraps the heading row/rows of a table to denote the head.
* -> The table head should be placed at the top of a table after any <caption> element and before any <tbody> element.
* -> After the table head may come either the <tbody> or <tfoot> elements.
* -> The <tbody> element should contain the primary data within a table.
* -> The <tfoot> element contains data thatn outlines the contents of a table.

Example
<table>
  <caption>Design and Front-End Development Books</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Item</th>
      <th scope="col">Availability</th>
      <th scope="col">Qty</th>
      <th scope="col">Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Don&#8217;t Make Me Think by Steve Krug</td>
      <td>In Stock</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>$30.02</td>
    </tr>
    ...
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Subtotal</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td>$135.36</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tax</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td>$13.54</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td>$148.90</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
