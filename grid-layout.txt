GRID LAYOUT WITH CSS
-> Having two columns means having three grid lines.
-> grid-column-start -> marks the start of the grid
-> grid-column-end -> marks the end of the grid.
-> grid column; is a short hand property for grid-column-start to grid-column-end;
-> For exmple if we want to make a header that stretches the full width of the page, we could have;

  * grid-column-start: 1;
    grid-column-end: 3;
     
    OR

  grid-column: 1 / 3;
  OR grid-column: 1 / span 2;

  OR grid-column: 1 / -1;
  // -1 targets the very last column line. Gives us more flexibility when we are adding columns and are not sure of the exact number of columns.

* -> Grid template areas allows us to define how the structure of our website should look like by assigning labels to each and every part of our website
