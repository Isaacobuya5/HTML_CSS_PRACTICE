Positioning with Inline-block
-> helping for laying out pages or placing elements next to one another.
-> display elements within a line allowing them to accept all box model properties;
* height, width, border and margin.
-> Allows us to take full advantage of the box model without having to worry about clearing floats.

-> Remember, because inline-block elements are displayed on the same line as one another, they normally include
a single space . When the size of each single space is added to the width and horizontal margin values  of all elements 
in the row, the total width becomes too great, pushing the last <section> element

-> In order to display all of the <section> elements on the same row, the whitespace between each section element must be removed.

Creating Reusable Layouts
Reccommendation
a. Use inline-block elements to create the grid/ layout of a page and then use floats to wrap content
around a given element.
Currently, there are new CSS specifications in the works - i.e. flex- and grid- based properties.
