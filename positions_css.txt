Uniquely Positioning Elements
Floats which remove an element from the flow of a page often produce unwanted results
as sorrounding elements floow around floated element.
-> Inline-block, unless we are creating columns can be fairly akward to get into proper position.
For these situations, we can use the "position" property in connection with "box offset" properties.

-> The "position" property identifies how an element is positioned on a page and whether or not it will
appear within the normal flow of a document.
-> This is used in conjuction with the box "off-set" properties;
* top
* right
* bottom
* left
-> which identifies exactly where an element will be positioned by moving elements in a number of different
directions.
-> By DEFAULT, every element has a position value of static which means that it exists in a normal flow of a document and doesn't accept any
box offset properties.
-> The "static" value is mostly overwritten with a "relative" or "absolute" value.

A. Relative Positioning
* The "relative" value for the position property allows elements to appear within the normal flow of a page,
leaving space for an element as intended while not allowing other elements to flow around it.
* It also allows an element's "display" position to be modified with the "box offset" properties.
-> Relative positioning therefore preserve the originial position of the element and other elements are not allowed to move into this space.
Additionally, box offset properties reposition the element allowing it to move top, left, right and bottom.

-> "box offset" properties identify where an element will be moved relative to its original position.

B. Absolute Positioning
-> The absolute value for the "position" property is different from the "relative" value in that an element with value of "position" will not appear within the normal
flow of a document and its original space and position of the absolutely positioned element will not be preserved.

->* Absolutely positioned elements are moved in relation to their closest relatively positioned parent element.
-> In case a relatively positioned parent element does not exist, the absolutely positioned element will be positioned
in relation to the <body> element.
